## 🔧 Technical Features

### Image Upload System
```typescript
// Secure file naming with user ID folder structure
const finalFileName = `${user.id}/avatar-${Date.now()}.${fileExt}`;

// Automatic blob conversion and upload
const response = await fetch(uri);
const blob = await response.blob();
const arrayBuffer = await blob.arrayBuffer();

// Supabase Storage upload with proper content type
const { data, error } = await supabase.storage
  .from('avatars')
  .upload(finalFileName, arrayBuffer, {
    contentType: blob.type || 'image/jpeg',
    upsert: true
  });
```

### Profile Editing System
```typescript
// Form state management with useEffect sync
React.useEffect(() => {
  if (employee) {
    setFirstName(employee.first_name || '');
    setLastName(employee.last_name || '');
    setPhone(employee.phone || '');
    setPosition(employee.position || '');
  }
}, [employee]);

// Database update with error handling
const handleSave = async () => {
  try {
    await updateEmployeeProfile({
      first_name: firstName,
      last_name: lastName,
      phone: phone,
      position: position
    });
    setEditing(false);
    Alert.alert('Framgång', 'Profilen har uppdaterats');
  } catch (error) {
    Alert.alert('Fel', 'Kunde inte uppdatera profilen');
  }
};
```

## 🔒 Security Implementation

### Row Level Security (RLS)
- Users can only upload to their own folder (`{userId}/`)
- Users can only delete their own images
- All avatar images are publicly viewable for profile display
- Proper authentication checks before upload operations

### File Restrictions
- **Max file size**: 5MB
- **Allowed formats**: JPEG, JPG, PNG, WebP
- **Aspect ratio**: Forced to 1:1 (square)
- **Quality**: Compressed to 80% for optimal performance

## 🎨 UI/UX Features

### Profile Picture Interface
- **Visual Feedback**: Camera icon overlay on profile picture
- **Loading States**: "Laddar..." overlay during upload
- **Platform-specific UX**: 
  - iOS: Native ActionSheet for photo selection
  - Android: Alert dialog for photo selection
- **Fallback Display**: User icon when no profile picture exists

### Editing Interface
- **Toggle Editing**: Single button to enter/exit edit mode
- **Form Reset**: Cancel button resets all fields to original values
- **Loading States**: Save button shows "Sparar..." during operations
- **Validation**: Real-time form state management

## 📱 Platform Support

### iOS
- Native ActionSheet for photo selection
- Requires camera and photo library permissions
- Automatic permission requests with user-friendly error messages

### Android
- Alert dialog for photo selection
- Proper permission handling
- Same functionality as iOS with platform-appropriate UI

### Web
- File picker integration (no camera access)
- Full upload and editing functionality
- Responsive design

## 🚀 Setup Instructions

### 1. Install Dependencies (Already Done)
```bash
npm install expo-image-picker
```

### 2. Set Up Storage Bucket
```bash
# Automatic setup
npm run setup-storage

# Or manual setup in Supabase Dashboard
# Create 'avatars' bucket with public access
```

### 3. Database Schema
```sql
-- Ensure avatar_url column exists
ALTER TABLE employees ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS avatar_url TEXT;
```

### 4. Test the Functionality
1. Start the app: `npm start`
2. Navigate to Profile tab
