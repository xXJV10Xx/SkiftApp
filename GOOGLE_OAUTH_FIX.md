# üîß Google OAuth Login Fix Guide

## üö® Current Issue
Google OAuth login is implemented in the code but not working because the credentials haven't been configured in Supabase.

## ‚úÖ Quick Fix Steps

### Step 1: Configure Google Cloud Console

1. **Go to Google Cloud Console**
   - Visit: https://console.cloud.google.com
   - Create a new project or select existing one

2. **Enable Google+ API**
   - Go to "APIs & Services" > "Library"
   - Search for "Google+ API" and enable it

3. **Create OAuth 2.0 Credentials**
   - Go to "APIs & Services" > "Credentials"
   - Click "Create Credentials" > "OAuth 2.0 Client IDs"
   - Choose "Web application"
   - Set application name: "Skiftappen"
   - Add these **Authorized redirect URIs**:
     ```
     https://fsefeherdbtsddqimjco.supabase.co/auth/v1/callback
     skiftappen://auth/callback
     ```
   - Click "Create"
   - **Save your Client ID and Client Secret**

### Step 2: Configure Supabase Dashboard

1. **Go to Supabase Dashboard**
   - Visit: https://supabase.com/dashboard
   - Select your project: `fsefeherdbtsddqimjco`

2. **Enable Google Provider**
   - Go to "Authentication" > "Providers"
   - Find "Google" and click "Enable"

3. **Add Google Credentials**
   - In the Google provider settings, enter:
     - **Client ID**: (from Google Cloud Console)
     - **Client Secret**: (from Google Cloud Console)
   - Add these **Redirect URLs**:
     ```
     skiftappen://auth/callback
     https://fsefeherdbtsddqimjco.supabase.co/auth/v1/callback
     ```
   - Click "Save"

### Step 3: Test the Fix

1. **Restart your development server**
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

2. **Test Google OAuth**
   - Go to the login screen
   - Click "Forts√§tt med Google" (Continue with Google)
   - You should be redirected to Google's OAuth page
   - After authorization, you should be redirected back to your app

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### If Google OAuth still doesn't work:

1. **Check Console Errors**
   - Open browser developer tools
   - Look for any error messages in the console
   - Check Supabase dashboard logs

2. **Common Error Messages & Solutions**

   **"Invalid redirect_uri"**
   - Make sure both URLs are added in Google Cloud Console
   - Make sure both URLs are added in Supabase dashboard
   - URLs must match exactly (no extra spaces)

   **"Client not found"**
   - Verify Client ID and Secret are correct
   - Check that Google+ API is enabled
   - Make sure you copied the credentials correctly

   **"Scheme not registered"**
   - Restart development server after configuration changes
   - Verify scheme is set to "skiftappen" in app.json

3. **Verify Configuration**
   - Check that `app.json` has `"scheme": "skiftappen"`
   - Verify Supabase URL and key are correct
   - Make sure all redirect URLs are properly configured

## ‚úÖ Success Indicators

You'll know Google OAuth is working when:

1. ‚úÖ Clicking "Forts√§tt med Google" opens Google's OAuth page
2. ‚úÖ After authorization, you're redirected back to your app
3. ‚úÖ You're automatically logged in and see the main app
4. ‚úÖ Your profile shows your Google account information

## üÜò Still Having Issues?

If you're still experiencing problems:

1. **Double-check all URLs** are correctly configured
2. **Restart the development server** after any configuration changes
3. **Check Supabase logs** in the dashboard for error messages
4. **Verify Google Cloud Console** settings are correct

The Google OAuth implementation in the code is complete and correct - it just needs the proper credentials configuration in Google Cloud Console and Supabase Dashboard.

## üì± Ready to Use

Once configured, users will be able to:
- Sign in with their Google account
- Access all app features
- Have their profile automatically created
- Use secure authentication

The fix is primarily configuration-based since the code implementation is already complete!
